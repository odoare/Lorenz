I am starting a new plugin project based on the JUCE plugin library. The project is called Lorenz. I would like to produce sound based on the simulation of the Lorenz attractor. This is a differential equation of three variables x, y and z, and 3 parameters. Do you know this differential equation ?

If yes, I would like you to create a pair of .h and .cpp files LorenzOsc.h and LorenzOsc.cpp which will implement the LorenzOsc class, whose ProcessBlock function will be used from LorenzAudioProcessor::processBlock of @PluginProcessor.cpp

The ProcessBlock of LorenzOsc class will implement a numerical integration of the Lorenz euqations. It should be possible to tune the timestep of the numerical equation.

Do you have enough information ?


You helped me to start a new plugin project based on the JUCE plugin library. The project is called Lorenz. It produces sound based on the simulation of the Lorenz attractor. This is a differential equation of three variables x, y and z, and 3 parameters that you are aware of.

The files LorenzOsc.h and LorenzOsc.cpp implement the LorenzOsc class, whose ProcessBlock function is used from LorenzAudioProcessor::processBlock of @PluginProcessor.cpp The ProcessBlock of LorenzOsc class implements a numerical integration of the Lorenz equations.

Can you add in the GUI a graphical view that displays the evolution of x,y,z with time ? That should be updated every 0.02s and display the path between each redraw.
